# **BuildAndDeployToGitHubPages**

## Welcome to **BuildAndDeployToGitHubPages**!

This is an example how to build and deploy to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions** (**CI.yml**). The **build** step is run on every branch, but the **deploy** step is run only on the **main** branch.  
**Prerequisite**: the root folder of the **gh-pages** branch must be set as source in the **GitHub Pages** section on the **Settings** tab of the repository.
